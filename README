Compile and running:
to compile type 'make'
THen it will generate the executable program.
Notice that in the Makefile, I use g++-5 as the compiler.
If your system doesn't have gcc-5 but has a gcc with higher 
than 5 version, you can replace the g++-5 to g++ in the Makefile.

After you generated the simcpu file, you can run the program like this:

./simcpu [-d] [-v] [-r quantum] < input_file


Question Answers:

I/II) My simulator does include a switch overhead time for every new thread, regardless of order, it does
not implement running to idle states. This was done because I assumed that for every time there is a
thread switch, it shouldn't matter when the thread comes in the queues
III) My simulator does not compensate for switching from blocked to ready queues
IV) My simulation does not accurately report switching from an interrupted state, to a highest priority
either.


* My program can run even with the comment in testfile
